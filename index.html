                In Quarter 4 of this year we aim to release the first beta of our first app. </br>
                In this app you can expect the following to be possible:</br>
                </br>
                -Game to spend tokens in, we will be trying to hit the social industry </br>
                and look to make a social app expect a partnership for this to be produced.</br>
                </br>
                -Possible introductions of a way to </br>
                bet tokens against your friends depending on restrictions.</br>
                </br>
                -App will have small fees to send tokens to the charity wallet </br>
                but will also include a way to adopt animals with your tokens.</br>
                </br>
                -Expect an introduction of app features in July </br>
                and the community will be able to trial features on the website first </br>
                as it's easier to produce.</br>
                </br>   
                There will also possibly come a second app!</br>
                This app will be focussed on charity.</br>
                The app will get a partnership with a charity to </br>
                adopt animals with tokens. (donations)</br>

            <img alt="chart" src="./images/macchart.png" class="floatright chart"/>
            <p>
               Every trade has a 10% fee, which is used to do the following:</br> </br>   
               &nbsp;7% From this fee gets redistributed to current holders, </br>   
               &nbsp;in proportion to their current holdings ofcourse!</br> </br>   
               &nbsp;3% From this fee get permanently burned.</br>   
               So you earn tokens just by holding!</br>   
               </br>   
               Supply</br>   
               Total supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000</br>   
               Current burned supply: 550,000,000,000,000</br>   
               Current circulating supply: 450,000,000,000,000</br>   
               50% Of the supply has been burned at the launch!</br>
               And 10% has already been burned by trading since the launch! </br></br>
               This means there is exponential DECAY int he circulating supply!</br>
               And exponential GROWTH in your own wallet so the longer you hold the better!

        <!--How to buy claw-->
        <div class="section animated" id="HTB">
            <h1>How to buy Claw</h1>
            <h3>Video tutorial coming soon...</h3>
            <h4 class="alignL">Step 1: Open an binance account</h4>
            <p class="alignL">
                Claw isn’t as accessible as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, so joining the trip to the moon is a bit harder. </br>
                You will need to make a binance account to use its decentralized exchange, Pancakeswap. </br>
                To use Pancakeswap you will need to buy BNB to pay fees on the Binance blockchain. </br>
                once you've bought your BNB on binance, you will need to send it to your compatible crypto wallet. </br>
                In step 2 it's explained how to create a crypto wallet. </br>
            </p>
            <h4 class="alignL">Step 2: Download a crypto wallet and connect it to BSC</h4>
            <p class="alignL">
                Hardware wallets are great for crypto investors looking to securely store their crypto assets offline while being able to use them online aswell.</br>
                In order to use Pancakeswap to buy CLAW, you'll need to use a software wallet that is compatible to the exchange.</br>
                Trustwallet and Metamask are good options, but you must enable them to work with the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) before using it for these tokens.</br>
                In this example we will use Metamask on a PC as crypto wallet to connect to the BSC.</br>
                </br>
                Most cryptocurrency users who interact with decentralized exchanges use Metamask wallet. </br>
                as its Google Chrome and FireFox extensions make it easy to use with other programs on your PC. </br>
                to do this, you'll need to install the extension and open it. once you've done that, you'll need to open the network drop down in the top right. </br>
                This is most likely set to "Main network". In this dropdown menu scroll down and click "costum RFP" and fill in the following information. </br>
                1. Network name: Binance Smart Chain </br>
                2. New RPC URL: https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org:443</br>
                3. ChainID: 56 </br>
                4. Symbol: BNB </br>
                5. Block Explorer: https://explorer.binance.org/smart </br>
                Once you've made your Metamask compatible with BSC, youre ready to make this purchase on Pancakeswap.</br>
            </p>
            <h4 class="alignL">Step 3: Make your purchase!</h4>
            <p class="alignL">
                Suprisingly, buying CLAW on pancakeswap is a much more simple process than setting up your crypto wallet and binance account. </br>
                The platform is an Automated Market Maker (AMM), meaning that it uses math to calculate token prices instead of order books. </br>
                This way, all you need to do is follow this link: </br></br>
                "https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x18a323b43a06c1319168f522513f318391f8cac5" </br></br>
                And then just connect your wallet to Pancakeswap to buy CLAW! </br>
                all you need to do now is put in the amount of BNB you want to use to buy CLAW,  up the slippage tolerance to 10-13% and buy!</br>
